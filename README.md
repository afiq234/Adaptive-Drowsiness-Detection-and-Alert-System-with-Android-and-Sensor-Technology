## 📱 Overview

This project is an **adaptive drowsiness detection system** designed to run on Android with support from wearable **sensor-based inputs** via **ESP32**, real-time cloud connectivity, and **machine learning models**. It detects signs of drowsiness and triggers alerts using physiological signals (like heart rate), motion, and facial cues.

The system combines:

- Flutter mobile app
- Firebase cloud services
- LSTM model for heart rate classification
- Sensor-based data collection via ESP32
- Real-time WebSocket

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🔄 Real-time heart rate data from ESP32
- 📡 Live communication using WebSocket
- 📊 LSTM-based heart rate classification
- 👁️‍🗨️ Facial landmark/motion-based drowsiness cues
- 🔔 In-app and audible alerts
- ☁️ Firebase integration (Firestore, Authentication, etc.)
- 📂 Modular code: Android app, ML training, firmware all separated

## ⚙️ Requirements

### 💻 Software
- Flutter SDK (3.x)
- Python 3.8+
- Firebase CLI
- Google Cloud Account (with Firebase enabled)
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for ESP32

### ☁️ Required Google Cloud Services
To fully enable cloud functionality, you must configure and connect:
- **Firebase Authentication** – for managing users
- **Firebase Firestore** – to store classified states and logs
- **Firebase Realtime Database** *(optional)* – for real-time sensor sync
- **Firebase Storage** *(optional)* – to store model or captured image data
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** *(optional)* – to send alerts/notifications

> ⚠️ Be sure to download and place your `google-services.json` inside `android/app/`

### 📦 Python Libraries
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Flutter setup

```bash
cd yolodetection/
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Python ML Training
Navigate to training_lstm_model/ and run the notebook or script to train/evaluate the LSTM model.

ESP32

- Open Esp32HeartRate in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO

- Flash it to your ESP32 board with the correct COM port and sensor connections

## 🔒 Security Note
⚠️ Your google-services.json file and sensitive model/data files are ignored from this repo. Add your own Firebase credentials to android/app/google-services.json.
